This is the repo for my personal (public) website. It is hosted on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com). This is a static website the relies on Hugo to
generate.

## Info

### Theme

The theme for this site is [Binario](https://github.com/vimux/binario).
Updating it is as simple as downloading the latest release and replacing the
files in `./themes/binario`.

### Makefile

There is a Makefile at the root of this repo. It's pretty messy right now and
needs some love. I will update this section after I have done that.
