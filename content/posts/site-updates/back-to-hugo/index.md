Once upon a time there was a full-stack software developer who could NOT stop
redoing his personal Website. I think this might be the 50th or 60th time I've
done it in the last 10ish years that I've owned this domain. I have used all
sorts of content management systems (even wrote a couple of my own) and static
site generators. WordPress, OctoberCMS, Pelican, Hugo, etc.

But I keep coming back to Hugo. Hugo is so powerful, fast, and flexible! The
reason I kept moving away from it was because I kept wanting to add API
endpoints to my blog for one reason or another.

Recently though I've been playing around with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
Vercel lets you add [serverless
functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/introduction). I played
around with them when I build [yell at
cloud](https://yell-at-cloud.vercel.app/). I even connected that up to
[supabase](https://supabase.io/).

This makes me all kinds of excited to be able to easily build/host a static
site, but also have the ability to add whatever other API endpoints I want or
need. I can imagine adding endpoints for creating new posts using
[IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) principals.

Going forward the theme might change, but I think (and hope) that **this** time
Hugo is going to stick!
