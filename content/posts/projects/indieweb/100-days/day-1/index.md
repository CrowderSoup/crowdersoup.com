I know, I know... I'm late. But [Tantek](https://tantek.com)'s
[post](https://tantek.com/2023/005/t3/indieweb-simpler-approach) about
a simpler approach to IndieWeb in his own 100 days series has inspired me to
embark on my own journey. Consistently writing in my blog for 100 days straight
won't be easy but I think it will be worth it. I think it will spark a creative
drive in me that has been lacking of late.

As with any "100 days" project there will be some days where the effort is
epic, and some days where it's lackluster at best. The point isn't to
proliferate some great work. The point is to just do the damn thing.

I think the part of Tantek's post today that really resonated with me was the
idea of decoupling creation from distribution. My blog is the perfect venue to
get messy and edit later. Very few people (if any) actually read my content
here first, which gives me the chance to experiment and hone my content BEFORE
I have to even think about sharing with the masses.

I also hope to find ways to streamline the process of posting to this blog over
the next 100 days. Surely consistent use will reveal the pain points. It will
help me find the bits I need to make better. The trick will then be finding the
_time_ to make them better.

In closing, this is my commitment to myself: I will blog here every day from
now until the 16th of April, 2023!
