If you follow me on social media you know that I've been traveling a 
LOT lately. Multiple trips a month level of traveling. It's been so 
much fun!

For context: my ex and co-parent (who I get along with famously) works
for an airline. She started back at the beginning of February. When she 
finished training is when I first started traveling a lot because she 
was nice enough to add me to her benefits until such a time as she has 
a new partner she wants to share them with.

What this means though, is that I'm flying standby. I may or may not 
make any given flight. That's just the risk you run flying for free.

### The cost

The flight is free, but what's your time worth? Are you okay burning 
hours of your life sitting in an airport? If not, then standby may 
not be for you.

**The true cost of flying for free is your time**. I'll say it again:
when you fly for free you're actually paying with your time instead of
money.

Can you handle being stuck in an airport all day? What about overnight?
Are you traveling to something you **can't** miss? Then flying standby 
might not be for you.

### Why I'm okay with it 

I'm able to work from anywhere with my job as a software engineer. 
I bring my laptop everywhere. If I don't make a flight I'm not going 
to miss work. Even if I'm in the airport all day long, I can just get 
my computer out and get my work done.

I also travel with my kids a lot. Parents know that getting kids through
the airport is one of the biggest challenges. But my girls have done 
it so much that they're pros. We've learned tricks to make security 
easier. They've got iPads to make killing time less painful.

### Summary

I know it's not for everyone. That's why I wrote this post. I don't 
want people to think flying for free is _actually_ free. The cost 
for some may be more than you're willing to pay. If I was traveling to 
something I couldn't miss I'd either pay for a ticket or travel a day 
early just in case. But most of the time? Give me airports, blue skies, 
and new experiences all day!
