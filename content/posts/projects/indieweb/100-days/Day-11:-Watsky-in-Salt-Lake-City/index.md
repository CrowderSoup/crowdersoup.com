Last night I had the chance to go see Watsky play at The Depot here in 
Salt Lake City. It was my second time seeing him in concert, but both 
where at the same venue. Today I've been reflecting on the differences 
in my experience between both shows.

The last concert was back in March of 2019. It was about a year before the 
covid pandemic. It was right after "Complaint" (the first album in the 
trilogy he just completed) came out. My favorite track from that album is
"Welcome to the Family" but it wasn't played. The energy at the show was 
good, but I was definitely disappointed to not hear that song.

However, last night he DID play it. Additionally in comparison, the energy
last night was surreal. Both the crowd and the band played off each other
so well. The set started with "Tiny Glowing Screens, Pt 2" and reminded 
me of Watsky's start in beat poetry.

I usually struggle with concerts because of sensory overload. However last 
night I didn't struggle at all. I've heard people talk about experiences at 
concerts before in a way that almost seems spiritual. I never understood it,
but after last night I think I do.

All in all, I think last night was an **excellent** start to concert season.
