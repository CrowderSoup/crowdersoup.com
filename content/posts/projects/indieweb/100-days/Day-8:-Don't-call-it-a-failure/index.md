> There are no such thing as failures, only lessons.

I've seen several variations on this quote. Regardless of the permutation 
though, they all distil to the same thought. Failure is an opportunity 
to learn.

I set out at the beginning of the year to blog every day for 100 days. I 
failed in that endeavor. However, I also learned something. I learned that
blogging every single day, for myself, is untenable. I just can't do it.

Some days I can write 2-3 posts. Some days? Zero. Less than zero (if that were
possible).

So instead of looking at this as a failed project I'm going to take the 
lesson and adjust my goal. Instead of 100 days consecutively, I will write 100 
posts total this year. Some might be written on the same day. Some might be 
short. But I will do my very best to hit 100.

That means I have to write ~3 blog posts per week. That's one down for this week!
