![Verified Commit Badge](./verified-commit-badge.png)

Have you ever noticed the "verified" badge next to a commit on GitHub?
A few years ago I did an wondered how I could get that on my own commits.
After a little googling I realized it was because those commits were 
signed.

Signing a commit with a GPG key is something natively supported by Git as
it turns out. Now this is one of the first things I set up on a new dev 
machine. Setting it up is fairly straight forward.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to have `gpg` and `git` installed. Additionally you will need
to use the command line (terminal). These instructions will work on both
OSX and Linux.

### Creating a GPG key

To create a GPG key run:

```sh
gpg --gen-key
```

Once created you can run the following:

```sh
‚ùØ gpg --list-keys
/home/crowdersoup/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------------
pub   rsa3072 2023-08-05 [SC] [expires: 2025-08-04]
      2E16095B42BB50E73C4B334E2BB8D361D964BC2F
uid           [ultimate] Aaron Crowder <aaron@crowder.cloud>
sub   rsa3072 2023-08-05 [E] [expires: 2025-08-04]
```

### Sign your commits

To tell git to sign your commits with your new GPG key you need to update
your global git config. You can edit the file (`git config --global -e`)
or run `git config --global user.signingkey <UID>`.

I also like to make sure I always sign my commits by default so I'll set 
`commit.gpgsign` to `true` (`git config --global commit.gpgsign true`).
That way any time I run `git commit` that commit will get signed.

### Tell GitHub about your GPG key

In order to tell GitHub about your GPG key you need to get your public 
key. You can do this by running:

```sh
gpg --armor --export <UID>
```

You will then copy the output of this command, and [paste it here](https://github.com/settings/gpg/new).
Once saved any commits you sign and push to GitHub will now have the 
"verified" badge!
