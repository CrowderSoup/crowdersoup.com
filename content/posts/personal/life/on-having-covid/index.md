I've been sick the past week or so. At first I was really hopeful that it
wasn't Covid. Even though my wife and kids had already tested positive.
I really really hoped that now, at the tail end of this thing, I could feel
like I had escaped. That I'd made it to the other side unscathed. But that was
not meant to be.

I tested positive one week ago today. At first I didn't want to believe it. But
there it was, a positive test result. It was such a strange sense of relief, mixed
with fear and frustration. Fear that I would get a lot more sick. Frustration at
still having to worry about this stupid fucking pandemic.

Relief though, because the rest of the family had it already. So it was only a 
matter of time before I wound up with it. I just wanted to get it over with.
Especially because my wife and kids all had super mild cases. Sick one day, seemingly
fine the next.

That was _not_ my experience though.

By Wednesday I wasn't getting better and the congestion had moved to my chest.
This made me nervous because as a child I had tuberculosis, and as a teen I had a 
collapsed lung. I made a doctors appointment and told them my concerns. After they 
verified that I did indeed have Covid they prescribed Paxlovid.

Within **hours** after my first dose I started feeling better. I am incredibly 
grateful for modern medicine. I have no doubt that without the vaccine, booster,
and Paxlovid that I would almost certainly be in the hospital.

Now, 7 days out (and 4 days from my first dose of Paxlovid) I'm feeling almost 
completely back to normal. They way I feel now could be described as "mild allergies".

I'm incredibly happy to be feeling better. I just cant help thinking about the early
days of the pandemic though. What would I have done if I'd caught Covid early on?
Would I be here to write this blog post without the medical interventions available 
today?

That said: I'm here, I'm fine. With any luck we're going to be on the other side of 
this pandemic very very soon.
