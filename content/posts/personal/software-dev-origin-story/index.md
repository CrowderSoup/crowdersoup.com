My software dev origin story is one you've probably heard a thousand times.
It started in the year 2000. My dad worked for an IT services company. I had 
access to computers from a very early age. We had broadband internet at home 
as soon as it was available.

This set the stage for me to be interested in websites and how the internet 
worked.
